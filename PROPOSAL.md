Engineering

## What is your data source?
MLS
City-Data.com

## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.
I will look for clean-ish data through APIs. I will scrape web sites if needed.
Columns will be dropped if irrelevant, and data points (rows) will be dropped if key data is missing. 

## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.
I will train a regression model with data, then test for accuracy.
The goal is to accurately complete 3 objectives:
1. Predict rent for a neighborhood in A, B, and C class properties (apartments).
2. Classify an area as A, B, or C based on crime rate, quality of schools, other available data
3. Highlight B or C properties in A areas, A properties in C areas, and C properties in B areas

## What is your overall goal with this project?
Build a tool that is useful to Real Estate investors who are looking for apartment buildings to acquire. 

## Anything else you want to note about your project?
I have domain expertise for this project, having been a Realtor, Construction Manager, and Property Manager.
