# ML Project Proposal
- Kelvin
- Pokedex Simulator

## What track are you choosing (analysis or engineering)?
Analysis, but Engineering also interests me. So I'm still not sure.

## What is your data source?
Either google or Bing images

## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.
Still haven't gotten them yet but will use it's API like what we did with twitter.

## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.

A pokedex is capable of determining what a specific pokemon is by feeding it an image. I will work on an algorithm that is capable of classifying up to 6 pokemons. 

## What is your overall goal with this project?
To help me understand Python more and to create something cool.

## Anything else you want to note about your project?
Nothing
