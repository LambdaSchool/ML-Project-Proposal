# ML Project Proposal
- Antonio Hernandez
- Selecting Features For Forcasting.

## What track are you choosing (analysis or engineering)?
Analysis, although if properly designed an API could be created to extract the most influential 
features from any large, high dimensional dataset assuming that such data is in the proper format without missing values.

## What is your data source?
Yahoo Finance
Barchart

## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.
The data is mostly available in csv format.  Although some scripting will be necessary to get additional data.
In order to obtain the additional data different methods could be needed from becoming familiar with an API, downloading a file and parsing it, to webscraping(not very likely).

## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.
Data is in either a csv or tsv format.  I plan to use SVM along with other models to attain the results I seek. 
## What is your overall goal with this project?
create a model to be able to make predictions on future stock prices.  

## Anything else you want to note about your project?
A simple website or a notebook will be setup to track how well my model did.
