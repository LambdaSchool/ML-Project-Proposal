# ML Project Proposal
- Jake Huneycutt
- Kaggle: Home Credit Default Risk
- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk

## What track are you choosing (analysis or engineering)?
Analysis (for now), but interested in engineering

## What is your data source?
https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data

## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.
There are several datasets to analyze and over 1 million rows of data; unsure how much cleaning is necessary right now

## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.
Supervised learning, classification (default or not), large dataset

## What is your overall goal with this project?
To work with a very complex data project and achieve a top 10% score on Kaggle

## Anything else you want to note about your project?
No

## Alternative Project Ideas
1.) Kaggle: Ames Housing Price data -> https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
* I've done some work on this already and want to finish it
* Don't necessarily know that it's a 2 week project, maybe more like 1 week
* Could do this project and then try to do Home Credit Default Risk project if I finish early

2.) South American Company Valuation
* Create long-term dataset built on publicly traded South American companies (reg expressions, possibly web scraping)
* Use dataset to make predictions on long-term valuations to create model for when time is to buy

3.) Predicting Sub-Saharan African nation GDP growth 2019 - 2040 (for investment purposes)
* Would use demographic data, world bank economic / health / education data, and Fraser Institute Economic Freedom data to make predictions
* difficulties: might be difficult putting together disparate data sources; predictions may still be difficult

4.) Valuing AT&T's Content Assets
* Would require finding data on Netflix + Amazon + Hulu content deals which could prove tricky
* Data will likely come from disparate sources; I can't find any centralized location reporting on content deals
* Use data on content deals to value AT&T's content assets (HBO, Turner, etc)
