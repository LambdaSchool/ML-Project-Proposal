# ML Project Proposal
- Saranya
- Cancer Detection using basic ANN Model.

## What track are you choosing (analysis or engineering)?
Engineering

## What is your data source?
https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.

Data has missing values and those values needed to be filled with appropriate values.

## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. 

Attribute Information:

1) ID number 2) Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign) 3-32)

Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter) b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values) c) perimeter d) area e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths) f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0) g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour) h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour) i) symmetry j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation".

Techniques:
1. ANN
2. Deep Learning

## What is your overall goal with this project?
Learn about implementing the above mentioned techniques by working with various different kinds of datasets.
