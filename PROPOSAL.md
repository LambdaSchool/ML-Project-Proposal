# ML Project Proposal
- Jake Huneycutt
- Kaggle: Home Credit Default Risk
- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk

## What track are you choosing (analysis or engineering)?
Analysis. 

At least for now, however, I'm interested in engineering as well. 

## What is your data source?
https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data

## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.
In order to predict home credit default risk, there are several datasets involved (~ 6-8). Would require a lot of cleaning, as well, possibly merging the datasets. Some entries in the contest have only used the main dataset, but I think it's likely that I'll need to use multiple datasets to achieve a high score. 

## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.
Supervised learning, classification (default or not), large dataset with over 300,000 customers and potentially more than 1 million rows of data. 

## What is your overall goal with this project?
To work with a very complex data project and achieve a top 10% score on Kaggle

## Anything else you want to note about your project?
* Pros: prize money, difficult competition that could showcase my skills, huge learning experience
* Cons: might not do as well as I hope; think I'm really going to have to dig into the data before I have any intuition about how well I will do; however, I'm not afraid of the challenge

## Alternative Project Ideas
1.) Kaggle: Ames Housing Price data -> https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques
* Description: real estate price prediction off of Ames, Iowa housing data
* Pros: Fun Kaggle project, show off my feature engineering skills, confident I can do well on it
* Cons: Easier than the home credit default risk contest; might finish it before 2 weeks are up
* Other comments: Could do this project and then try to do Home Credit Default Risk project if I finish early

2.) South American Company Valuation
* Description: Get data from South American publicly traded companies over the past 10 - 20 years and use the data to make valuation predictions (i.e. when to buy stocks)
* Pros: Would be very valuable to investment firms and would help me on a long-term goal; moving more in the direction of engineering
* Cons: Might not be do-able in 2 weeks; biggest challenge would be obtaining the data to begin with
* Other comments: would require lot of work with regular expressions, maybe web scraping, lots of data cleaning, even Spanish language translation built into my program; this is all do-able, but might not be realistic in the required timeframe

3.) Predicting Sub-Saharan African nation GDP growth 2019 - 2040 
* Description: Use various data sources (World Bank, healthcare, education, demographics, Fraser economic freedom) to make predictions about GDP growth for sub-Saharan African countries for purposes of investment
* Pros: potentially valuable to investment firms investing in emerging and frontier markets
* Cons: might be difficult putting together disparate data sources; even if I get all the data, no guarantee that the predictions will be valuable; economic growth can be very tricky to forecast over a long-term timeframe since political situations can change quickly

4.) Valuing AT&T's Content Assets
* Description: Use data on Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu's content deals in order to try to predict the future value of AT&T's content assets acquired from Time Warner, Turner, and HBO
* Pros: could land me a job with a company like Time Warner / Turner / HBO; high personal interest in this topic
* Cons: finding good data could prove very tricky; all these companies are secretive and I would have to use various press releases, articles, financial statements, and even deduction to try to find content deal pricings. 
* Other comments: Might work on this as a personal semi-data science project, but I'm concerned I won't be able to find enough reliable data for it to work as a full data science project.

5.) Healthcare Data
* Not a concrete idea, per se, but interested in healthcare data. I have not found an interesting topic on this subject yet, though.
