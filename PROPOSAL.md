# ML Project Proposal
- Mariano Scandizzo
- Data visualization with Python & JavaScript

## What track are you choosing (analysis or engineering)?
Engineering.
What I would like to develop is a template pipeline to allow me to gather, process data and deliver visualizations.
Becuase this is a complex topic I will rely on "Data Visualization with Python & JavaScript" Kyran Dale, O'reilly as a reference to create my project

## What is your data source?
I will collect data from Twitter to create a sentiment analysis

## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.
I would like to take raw data from twitter and use Vader Sentiment to calculate sentiment analysis.
I am planning to use MongoDB to store the data, Flask as a server and finally D3 to run the visualization.

## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.
Json kind data

## What is your overall goal with this project?
To create a template pipeline. 
I want to have a framework that i could use in real life.
My objective is whenver I have a need to produce an analysis to have a template where I only have to create a new database, gather the data, do the data science portion and after that I have a pre made flask framework and the the only other details will be to modify the D3 charts picking the right kind and tuning it.

## Anything else you want to note about your project?
I think that probably Aaron would be a great help since I know that it is an ambitious project to I will certainly experience more problems than what I initially anticipate.
