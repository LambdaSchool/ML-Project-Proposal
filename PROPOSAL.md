# ML Project Proposal
- Brenner Haverlock
- Crypto Market Analysis/Prediction

## What track are you choosing (analysis or engineering)?
Analysis

## What is your data source?
I will be using the dataset/API from https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/ to predict outcomes.

## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.
The dataset will most likely need to be cleaned for the data I am given. This is a new concept so I will need to review the models and find my solution to the best formatted data.


## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.
Structure will be using Deep Learning with LTSM(Long Term Short Memory) and using Python techniques learned in the past to make it all come to magic. 

## What is your overall goal with this project?
Provide a accurte yet simple way to predict the stock market in a python app

## Anything else you want to note about your project?
I plan on picking up and using TensorFlow to build models of linear regression.
