# ML Project Proposal
- Saranya
- Cancer Detection using Deep Learning

## What track are you choosing (analysis or engineering)?
Engineering

## What is your data source?
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/predict-idc-in-breast-cancer-histology-images/data

## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.
Dataset for this problem has been collected by researcher at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. This dataset is preprocessed by nice people at Kaggle and can be used directly.


## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.
There are 162 whole mount slides images available in the dataset. These slides have been scanned at 40x resolution. Finally, those slides then are divided 275,215 50x50 pixel patches. Then one label of 0 or 1 is assigned to each of these patches. For patches that include IDC has label of 1 and patches that donâ€™t include IDC have label of 0.

Techniques Used:
ResNet architecture 

## What is your overall goal with this project?
Learn about image classification techniques.

## Anything else you want to note about your project?
