# ML Project Proposal
- Qiping Sun
- Dog Breed Identification/Determine the breed of a dog in an image

## What track are you choosing (analysis or engineering)?
Engineering

## What is your data source?
Kaggle

## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.
The data was provided with a training set and a test set of images of dos.
Each image has a filename that is its unique 'id'. The dataset comparises 120 breeds of dogs. 

train.zip - the training set, you are provided the breed for these dogs
test.zip - the test set, you must predict the probability of each breed for each image
labels.csv - the breeds for the images in the train set

For cleaning part, I think I will check the missing value and drop the unnecessary data as well.
For the more details for cleaning I think I need to take care while I'm working on it, can't really think about it right now

## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.
The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining a dog's breed from a photo.
I will try to use Keras + TensorFlow backend, but need to check if it's a good one.

## What is your overall goal with this project?
Build the model and can identifiy the breed of a dog in an image with higher accuracy score

## Anything else you want to note about your project?
Not sure for now.
