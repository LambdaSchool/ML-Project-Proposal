## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.
I want to merge data from many sources, so I need to find a way to identify and track geographic locations listed in many ways (zip code, school district, city etc.). Likely I will create tables like those used in Spark.

## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.
Tables are highly structured, and I will create tables from them also highly structured. I will be looking for correlations among many health factors and educational attainment. Regression is likely to be one technique I use but I would also like to test correlation using accuracy of other prediction models.

## What is your overall goal with this project?
Determine and describe correlation between health risk factors and outcomes with educational attainment.

## Anything else you want to note about your project?
