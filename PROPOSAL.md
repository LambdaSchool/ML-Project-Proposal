# ML Project Proposal
- Matthew Tomas
- Dance Movement Classification and Translation

## What track are you choosing (analysis or engineering)?
Engineering

## What is your data source?
Online dance videos (primarily from YouTube and Vimeo)

## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.
There are thousands of source videos of dance. Finding clear images to train the model will require time and curation.

## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.
The data are moving images. Using edge detection it is possible to identify and then track various parts of a body. A good starting point for my initial attempts will be to follow the tutorial here (https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/21/opencv-track-object-movement/).

## What is your overall goal with this project?
The overall goal of this project is to translate two dimensional movement into Labanotation or Laban/Bartinieff movement analysis notation for the purposes of archiving and then recreating historical dances and ethnic dances from around the world. Ideally, a user could input a video and receive as output the appropriate notation.

## Anything else you want to note about your project?
There are a lot of potential stretch goals for this project, and it is something that I might work on very long-term as it is near and dear to the work my girlfriend does.

Minimally, I will pair this with a Labanotation to animation program so that notated works can be imagined in both two and three dimensions (eventually in VR so that the viewer can walk around the dancer that was originally derived from 2D video).

It would also be possible, maybe, to feed the corpus of a choreographer's work in and produce new works in the style of.

Lastly, of course, this could be used with movement of all varieties, not just dance.
