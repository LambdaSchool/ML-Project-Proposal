# ML Project Proposal
- STUDENT NAME: Sebastian Norena
- PROJECT TOPIC/NAME: Twitter sentiment analysis

## What track are you choosing (analysis or engineering)?
engineering

## What is your data source?
twitter

## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.
I will apply the techniques learned on the NLP part of the course, which are tokenizing and removing punctuation, so the sentiment analysis is more accurate.

## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.
it would be unstructured data, as the text messages don’t have a special structure. The objective for this project does not involve applying a particular model, only doing some sentiment analysis on the text.

## What is your overall goal with this project?
Performing sentiment analysis on a particular word or topic live on twitter.

## Anything else you want to note about your project?
not for now
