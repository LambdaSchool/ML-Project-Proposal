# ML Project Proposal
- Tina Kovacova
- Anomaly Detection with focus on Fraud Prevention

## What track are you choosing (analysis or engineering)?
Ideally this project will incorporate both analysis and engineering features however I'm gravitating more towards analysis at this point.

## What is your data source?
My actual dataset is TBD as I was having difficulties to find non-proprietary datasets on fraud detection that do not belong to the "training purpose" category. I will conduct further search later on this week, however some of my options are:

[TalkingData Ad Tracking Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection/data)

[Credit Card Fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

[KDD Dataset](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html)

Preferably, I'm trying to find suitable datasets in the information security or potentially biotech industries (i.e. fingerprint scanning).  

## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.
TBD; the TalkingData dataset already comes with training and testing data split, however I have yet to look into NaNs and other data clean-up & feature engineering needs. 

My overarching goal is to develop skillset where I will be able to apply anomaly detection techniques and algorithms across various datasets; so time permitting I would like to examine more than one dataset. 

## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.
In terms of models and techniques, there are several approaches that could be used, I intend to gain at least a fundamental understanding of: 

- RKDE: Robust Kernel Density Estimation
- OCSVM: One Class SVM
- LOF: Local Outlier Factor
- IFOR: Isolation Forest

## What is your overall goal with this project?
1. My main goal is to develop transferable skills and knowledge; and to gain clear understanding of various algorithms and options applicable for fraud detection & prevention techniques across various industries and use cases (as much as possible within the 2-week time frame allocated for this project). This includes developing a model that predicts fraud occurrences at the very least at the current market success rates.

2. Interpretation and visualization of the results for non-technical audiences 

3. [Stretch goal 1] Understanding not only "how" but also "why" fraud happens 

4. [Stretch goal 2] Developing techniques to minimize and mitigate fraud from business risk perspective

## Anything else you want to note about your project?
My working file for the research for this project:

My biggest challenge in this project will be associated with the implementation of the ML models as I have been only programming for three months to date and I am limited to Python.
