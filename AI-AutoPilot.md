# ML Project Proposal
- Troy Bradley
- AI powered Auto Pilot for General Aviation

## What track are you choosing (analysis or engineering)?
Engineering

## What is your data source?
MS Flight Sim will be the environment / data source

## Summarize the status of your data and what cleaning is needed.
No data cleaning is needed. 

## Summarize the structure of your data and what models/techniques work with it.
I want to train a Neural Net to generate and execute the steps needed to fly a simulated Cessna Skyhawk from one rural airport to another
within MS Flight Sim. Steps to include:
- Preflight checklist
- Takeoff
- Climb to set altitude
- Cruise to destination
- Enter landing pattern
- Land

## What is your overall goal with this project?
Build a foundation for an eventual next generation AutoPilot, eventually with NLP so the plane understands voice commands from 
- The Pilot In Command
- Air Traffic Control
- Passengers

It should also log all communications, especially those with ATC. 

## Anything else you want to note about your project?
This is a very ambitious project, but with OpenAI doing well against DOTA players with a team of 5 bots, I think I can 
"Stand on the shoulders of giants" and get this done.
